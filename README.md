# haptic_explorer
A GUI to explore haptics feedback effects by sending data to haptic band over BlueTooth LE

This used to be a part of my AeVA product testing suite. AeVA (http://www.vasuyantra.com/aeva) is an Artificial Intelligence enabled
Vision Assistant. AeVA helps the visually impaired better navigate physical spaces like malls and sidewalks. It assists in the perception
of immediate surroundings through real-time haptic feedback and audio cues.

This repository contains haptics explorer that allows sending signals to the Bluetooth haptics band (I will be open-sourcing that code
soon) directly for testing purpose.

The main pieces of the code are the BLE sender and the Glade GUI. Quite simple, actually.
