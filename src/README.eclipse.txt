To create an Eclipse project run following:

%> cd build
%> cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../


The .cproject and .project files in build dir are already checked in. However, there are some hardcoded paths generated by cmake in .cproject. It is better to regenerate the files by running the above command. There is no need to check in the newly changed files (add to .gitignore).
